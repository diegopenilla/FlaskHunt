# Info

This program was written in Python and displays a graphical interface for analyzing the data produced by [Z-Hunt II](http://www.jbc.org/content/267/17/11846.full.pdf),
an updated version of [Z-Hunt](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1167176/pdf/emboj00173-0317.pdf) that analyzes a given DNA sequence and looks up for regions with potential to form Z-DNA. 
As mentioned by the authors:

>" The computer program (Z-Hunt-II) developed for this study uses a rigorous thermodynamic search strategy to map the occurrenceof left-handed Z-DNA in genomic sequences. The search algorithm has been optimized to search large sequences for the potential occurrence of Z-DNA, taking into account sequence type, length, and cooperativity for a given stretch of potential Z-DNA-forming nucleotides."

### Z-Score

To do this the program computes for each base pair of the given DNA sequence, a value called Z-Score.

> "In practical terms, the Z-Score relates the ability for a given sequence to adopt the Z conformation relative to a random sequence. We can also interpret the Z-Score as the number of random sequences that must be searched to find a nucleotide sequence that is as good or better at forming Z-DNA than the sequence in question."

The original Z-Hunt II accepts 5 arguments to run:

- `DNA`: as a sequence made up A, T, G and C.
- `windowsize`: the length of the search window.
- `minsize`
- `maxsize`
- `filename`: the name of the text file with the results.

For this application, some of these arguments have been specified: `windowsize=8`, `minsize=6`, `maxsize=8` (they appear to replicate correctly the results published by the authors, there is little to no information about the exact meaning of these arguments).
To program has been adapted to make a use of a web form. Fill it by giving a DNA sequence and a its name. The program makes use of a database in [firebase](http://firebase.google.com) to store the given information. After you hit hit submit, the backend would produce a table and a simple plot to visualize the results.

**NOTE**: I haven't implemented any type of authentication in the application so the database currently has no security and might be unreliable. 
Also I'm still unsure of how the application would behave when there is more than one user (more than one thread).
